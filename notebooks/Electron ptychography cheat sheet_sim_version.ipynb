    "A ptychography experiment should satisfy sampling and overlap criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Things go much smoother if the diffraction pattern is fully sampled on the detector. The real space pixel size is given by \n",
    "$$\\Delta x = \\lambda / \\theta_D,$$\n",
    "where \n",
    "$$\\theta_D = {D \\over L}$$\n",
    "is the lateral opening angle of the detector, with $D = N s = 256 \\times 55 \\mathrm{\\mu m} = 14.08 \\mathrm{mm}$ is the width of the Merlin detector and $L$ the camera length.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case the Nyquist criterion is equivalent to the statement that the illumination must not be wider than half the real-space field of view:\n",
    "$$w < \\frac{N}{2} \\Delta x,$$\n",
    "or\n",
    "$$w < \\frac{\\lambda L}{2 s}.$$\n",
    "If $\\alpha$ is the convergence semi-angle and the sample is defocused by a distance $d$, then $w \\approx 2 \\alpha d$, and \n",
    "$$d < \\frac{\\lambda L}{4 \\alpha s}.$$\n",
    "For $30\\;\\mathrm{keV}$ electrons, $L = 18.3\\;\\mathrm{cm}$ and $\\alpha = 24.2\\;\\mathrm{mrad}$, the defocus should never be larger than $240\\;\\mathrm{nm}$. For now I'd suggest that we not venture further than half of this limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure sufficient redundancy in the dataset, neighbouring illuminated regions have to overlap. A possible rule of thumb is to adjust the step size so that, for the inner part of the scanned area, every part is illuminated more than once. With a disc illumination on a square lattice, this means a step size roughly $35\\%$ the diameter of the probe. From what we obtained above, we get that the step size $l$ (sorry I'm running out of variables already) is limited by the inequality\n",
    "$$l < 0.35 w$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reciprocal space overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "This is relevant only when imaging periodic samples. Information on the position the probe within a unit cell is encoded in the interference between the Bragg discs. To ensure that this is not a problem, the aperture size has to be large enough. For a unit cell width $a$, we must have\n",
